Files
--------------------------
On sending VM:
--deploy.bsh

On receiving VM:
--dothis.bsh
--purge.bsh
--receive.bsh

On both VMs:
--dump_archive.bsh


Directory Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------
On sending VM:
/bundle:
/archive_tar, where all tars go for backup purposes
/files, the directory containing the files to be sent
deploy.bsh, the file to run to push out the update
dump_archive.bsh, a file which will dump all the backup tar files

On receiving VM:
/home/deploy:
dothis.bsh, the file that is called on ssh'ing from the sending VM to the receiving VM

/deploy/bundle/in: the directory for incoming bundles
/archive_tar, where all tars go for backup purposes
  (This is important for rollback!)
/files, the directory containing the files when they are unzipped
bundle##.tar, the active bundle
  DO NOT DELETE THIS FROM THE DIRECTORY OR receive.bsh AND purge.bsh WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY!!
receive.bsh, the file that runs to install the new incoming package
purge.bsh, the file that removes the current package and rolls back to the previous working version
dump_archive.bsh, a file which will dump all the backup tar files

/deploy/bundle/out: the directory for outgoing bundles
(will mirror the sending VM /bundle directory)
